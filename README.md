# APPIUM MOBILE AUTOMATION FRAMEWORK

```
Compatible With Android Oreo and IOS 11
Uses explicit waits internally in all of the `src/main/java/com/company/project/utilities/AppiumUtil.java` functions that return mobile elements.  
  
Supports Parallel runs via testNG xml configuration  
Note : an appium server supports onl one device, make sure multiple appium server instances are run to support parallel execution
`open -n /Applications/Appium.app` - should do the trick on a mac to initialize a new instance of appium server

Works With Native, Web & Hybrid Apps.
Works on Emulators, Simulators & Real Devices.
